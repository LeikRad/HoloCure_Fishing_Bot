# Summary

This is a bot written to play the fishing minigame that is featured in HoloCure.
I got the idea after seeing a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/holocure/comments/15vhz6l/so_i_wrote_a_bot_that_plays_the_fishing_minigame/) of a bot that does the same thing in action, but the code wasn't available (◞‸ ◟ ；), so I decided to try and do it as a way to learn Computer Vision and other topics.

# Instructions


I only tested this out on windows, but if the demand is high I'll look into making it compatible for linux or macos.

## Pre-requeriments:
- Python

## Steps:
TODO

## Setup:
